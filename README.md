#### Recover your private keys with the help of your trusted accounts!
> This project solves the problem of users permanently losing access to their funds due to lost or forgotten private keys.

> One of the main challenges of using cryptocurrencies is the risk of losing access to funds due to lost or stolen private keys. Private keys are used to access and manage cryptocurrency funds, and if they are lost or stolen, the user may permanently lose access to their funds. Key recovery wallets with MPC and ZKP solve this problem by offering a highly secure way to recover lost or stolen private keys.

> Multiple parties can work together using MPC to reconstruct a user's private key without any one party having access to the full key. ZKP can be used to verify the correctness of the reconstructed key without revealing any additional information about the key itself.
Also keeps you informed throughout the recovery process with notifications to ease the user experience.
